# Experimental-Project

In this project I experimented with three different game mechanics and/or systems.

The first project is a small Flappy Bird clone which I renamed as Flappy triangles. Playable Link: https://munstudios.itch.io/flappy-triangle
The second project is a redo of the venting mechanic from among us. Showcase Link: https://www.facebook.com/munstudios360/videos/3226059990836612/
The third project is a 2d swing mechanic tryout.

These three projects were my first unity projects as a beginner when I was learning unity. I did many more experiments which I forgot to put in git and lost due to a ransomware attack ðŸ˜”
